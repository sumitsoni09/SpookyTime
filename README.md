Welcome to Hidden Haunts, your hub for exploring the paranormal world. With Hidden Haunts, users can view a list of huanted sites in the United States and view details about those haunts.

Approach Taken: A MEAN stack, full CRUD app. As a group we collectively created a Waffle.io board where we could easily manage and assign tasks. Back-end and Front-end functionality were created simultaneously with communication between members via Slack and Zoom.
