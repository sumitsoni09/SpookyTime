Welcome to Hidden Haunts, your hub for exploring the paranormal world. With Hidden Haunts, users can view a list of huanted sites in the United States and view details about those haunts.

Approach Taken: A MEAN stack, full CRUD app. As a group we collectively created a Waffle.io board where we could easily manage and assign tasks. Back-end and Front-end functionality were created simultaneously with communication between members via Slack and Zoom.

## User Stories
* Users can view details about a haunt.
* Users can visit the gift shop.
* Users can create a username and log in.

## Future Optimizations
* ### Browse Haunted Places
  - Search bar: filter huants by category - haunted house, haunted places, scare level
* ### Rate Haunt
  - User can rate the scare factor for each haunt.
* ### Only admin can add a new haunt, edit, delete a haunt.
  - In the future only admin are able to see the edit and delete button as well as make changes
